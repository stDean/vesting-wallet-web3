# Vesting Wallet Smart Contract
A secure, transparent, and trustless vesting solution for ERC-20 tokens, built on Ethereum. This smart contract automates the distribution of tokens to team members, investors, and advisors according to a customizable linear vesting schedule.

## Overview
Managing token allocations with spreadsheets or promises is error-prone and lacks transparency. This Vesting Wallet contract solves that by deploying an immutable, on-chain schedule that anyone can audit. Once deployed, the rules are set in stone: tokens are released automatically over time, ensuring commitment and building trust within any project's ecosystem.
